The project can be straightforwardly read from the MagolegoProject.ipynb file with no need of any complementary file.

Caution: As the main notebook file is quite heavy it may not render on github from the first time. 
	 You may need to refresh the page several times.

We conducted the SHAP algorithm on a big set of reviews and on a smaller set of reviews. 
Both tries can be respectively found on Shap_big_set.ipynb and Shap_small_set.ipynb

The dataset that we initially used is stored as tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv. In addition there are two derived files
from this dataset (rating_large.csv and sentiment_large.csv) that are created for performance reasons. Its creation 
is contained in the main notebook as well.
